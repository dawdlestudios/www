title: Creating Websites
---

So you want to create a website? Great! This guide will show you how to get started.

The way dawdle.space works it that any thing you put in your `public` folder will be accessible from the internet. Upload your files there and they will be available at `https://your-username.dawdle.space/filename`.

If you don't want to do any coding, there are a few tools that can help you create a website:

- [Marktext](https://www.marktext.cc/)\
  A desktop app that lets you write Markdown and export it to HTML (with a bunch of themes)
- [Publii](https://getpublii.com/)\
  A desktop app that lets you create a website without coding
- [Markdown to HTML](https://markdowntohtml.com/)\
  A website that lets you convert Markdown to HTML

**Static Site Generators**

If you want to create a more complex website than just a few HTML files, like a blog or a portfolio, you can use a static site generator like [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/). See [Creating a Website with Zola](/wiki/guide/zola) for more information.

Other static site generators you can use are [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), or [Astro](https://astro.build/) (what this site is built with).

## HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

You might have already noticed the `index.html` file in your `public` folder. This is the default page that will be shown when you visit your site.
We've already created a simple website for you, but you can change it however you want.

HTML is the language used to create websites. It's a markup language, which means you use tags to create elements. For example, `<h1>Hello World!</h1>` will create a big heading.
Here are some simple things you can try out:

- `<h1>Hello World!</h1>` will create a big heading
- `<a href="https://example.com">Link</a>` will create a link to `https://example.com`
- `<br>` will create a line break
- `<p>Some text</p>` will create a paragraph
- `<img src="https://example.com/image.png">` will create an image
