title: Dawdle Chat
---

The chat is based on a simple custom protocol. Only the last 20 messages are stored in the server's memory and are not persisted. The chat is encrypted, but not end-to-end encrypted. The server can read all messages.

## Alternative clients

Right now, there is only the web client. You can also open just the chat at https://dawdle.space/chat/embed.

It would be nice to have e.g. a irc bridge, something to look into in the future.
